Author: Christina Joslin 

## Instructions (from Intellij IDEA) 

1) All threads will be generated from the main method in ControlFlowMenu.java. To run this program for multiple users at the same time, click on the ControlFlowMenu.java class, go to the configuration icon on the top right corner of your screen, click "edit configurations", "modify options", and then select "allow multiple instances." 

2) Now that you have set up the multiple instances feature, run the main method in ControlFlowMenu.java. A JOptionPane will appear and you will be prompted if you are a buyer or seller. From there, you will enter your existing login information and/or create a new account. 

3) A JOptionPane stating that you logged in successfully will appear and from there you can navigate across the buyer/seller pages accordingly.
